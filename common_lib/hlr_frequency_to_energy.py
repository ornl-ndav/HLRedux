def frequency_to_energy(obj, **kwargs):
    """
    This function converts a primary axis of a SOM or SO from frequency
    to energy. The frequency axis for a SOM must be in units of THz.
    The primary axis of a SO is assumed to be in units of THz. A tuple
    of [frequency, frequency_err2] (assumed to be in units of THz) can be
    converted to [energy, energy_err2].

    Parameters:
    ----------
    -> obj is the SOM, SO or tuple to be converted
    -> kwargs is a list of key word arguments that the function accepts:
          units= a string containing the expected units for this function.
                 The default for this function is THz

    Return:
    ------
    <- A SOM or SO with a primary axis in energy or a tuple converted to
       energy

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    <- TypeError is raised if the incoming object is not a type the function
       recognizes
    <- RuntimeError is raised if the SOM x-axis units are not THz
