def weighted_average(obj, **kwargs):
    """
    This function takes a SOM or SO and calculates the weighted average for
    the primary axis.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    -> obj is a SOM or SO that will have the weighted average calculated from
       it
    -> kwargs is a list of key word arguments that the function accepts:
          start=<index of starting bin>
          end=<index of ending bin>
    
    Return:
    ------
    <- A tuple (for a SO) or a list of tuples (for a SOM) containing the
       weighted average and the uncertainty squared associated with the
       weighted average

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    <- TypeError is raised if a tuple or another construct (besides a SOM or
       SO) is passed to the function
