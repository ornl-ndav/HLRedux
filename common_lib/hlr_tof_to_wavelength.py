def tof_to_wavelength(obj, **kwargs):
    """
    This function converts a primary axis of a SOM or SO from time-of-flight
    to wavelength. The wavelength axis for a SOM must be in units of
    microseconds. The primary axis of a SO is assumed to be in units of
    microseconds. A tuple of (tof, tof_err2) (assumed to be in units of
    microseconds) can be converted to (wavelength, wavelength_err2).

    Parameters:
    ----------
    -> obj is the SOM, SO or tuple to be converted
    -> kwargs is a list of key word arguments that the function accepts:
          pathlength= a tuple or list of tuples containing the pathlength and
                      its associated error^2
          inst_param= a string containing the type of parameter requested
                      from an associated instrument. For this function the
                      acceptable parameters are primary and secondary. Default
                      is primary.
          units= a string containing the expected units for this function.
                 The default for this function is microseconds

    Return:
    ------
    <- A SOM or SO with a primary axis in wavelength or a tuple converted to
       wavelength

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    <- TypeError is raised if the incoming object is not a type the function
       recognizes
    <- RuntimeError is raised if the SOM x-axis units are not microseconds
    <- RuntimeError is raised if a SOM does not contain an instrument and
       no pathlength was provided
    <- RuntimeError is raised is no SOM is provided and no pathlength given
