    This function combines Steps 1 through 3 in section 2.4.6.1 of the data
    reduction process for Reduction from TOF to lambda_T as specified by
    the document at
    U{http://neutrons.ornl.gov/asg/projects/SCL/reqspec/DR_Lib_RS.doc}. The
    function takes a list of file names, a L{hlr_utils.Configure} object,
    region-of-interest (ROI) file for the normalization dataset and processes
    the data accordingly.

    @param datalist: The filenames of the data to be processed
    @type datalist: C{list} of C{string}s

    @param conf: Object that contains the current setup of the driver
    @type conf: L{hlr_utils.Configure}

    @param roi_file: The file containing the list of pixel IDs for the region
                     of interest. This only applies to normalization data. 
    @type roi_file: C{string}

    @param kwargs: A list of keyword arguments that the function accepts:

    @keyword timer:  Timing object so the function can perform timing
                     estimates.
    @type timer: C{sns_timer.DiffTime}


    @return: Object that has undergone all requested processing steps
