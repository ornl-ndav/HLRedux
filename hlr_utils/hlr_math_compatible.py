    This function takes two SOMs and checks them for the following conditions:
    1. The number of SOs in SOM1 is the same as SOM2
    2. The units of the primary axes in SOM1 match those in SOM2
    3. The y units of SOM1 match the y units in SOM2

    If all three steps pass, nothing is done. If one step fails an exception
    is raised.
    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    -> som1 is the first SOM to compare
    -> som2 is the second SOM to compare

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    <- IndexError is raised if the number of SOs in SOM1 and SOM2 are not equal
    <- RuntimeError is raised if the units of the primary axes in SOM1 do not
       match those in SOM2
    <- RuntimeError is raised if the y units in SOM1 is not the same as in SOM2
