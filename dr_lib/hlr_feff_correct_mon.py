    """
    This function takes in a monitor SOM, calculates efficiencies based on
    the montior's wavelength axis and divides the monitor counts by the
    calculated efficiencies. The function is a constant * wavelength.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    -> obj is a SOM or SO containing monitor spectra
    -> kwargs is a list of key word arguments that the function accepts:
           units= a string containing the expected units for this function.
                  The default for this function is Angstroms
                  
    Returns:
