def filter_pixels(obj, paths, start_ids, end_ids, **kwargs):
    """
    This function filters a set of pixels based on starting and ending IDs
    for each data path.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    -> obj is a SOM that needs to be filtered
    -> paths is a list of tuples containing the NeXus data paths and signals
    -> start_ids is a list of tuples containing the starting ID pairs (i,j)
                 for each data path in paths
    -> end_ids is a list of tuples containing the ending ID pairs (i,j) for
               each data path in paths

    Returns:
    -------
    <- A tuple of containing the SOM with the pixels in the filter range and
       SOM containing the rest of the pixels not filtered

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    <- TypeError is raised if obj is not a SOM
    <- RuntimeError is raised if the number of data paths, starting IDs and
                    ending IDs are not all identical
