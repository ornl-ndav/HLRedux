    This function takes a list of U{NeXus<www.nexusformat.org>} files and
    various keyword arguments and returns a data C{SOM} and a monitor C{SOM}
    that is the sum of all the data from the specified files. B{It is assumed
    that the files contain similar data as only crude cross-checks will be
    made. You have been warned.}

    @param filelist: A list containing the names of the files to sum
    @type filelist: C{list}
    
    @param kwargs: A list of keyword arguments that the function accepts:
    
    @keyword SO_Axis: This is the name of the main axis to read from the NeXus
                      file
    @type SO_Axis: C{string}
    
    @keyword Data_Paths: This contains the data paths and signals for the
                         requested detector banks
    @type Data_Paths: C{tuple} of C{tuple}s

    @keyword Mon_Paths: This contains the data paths and signals for the
                        requested monitor banks
    @type Mon_Paths: C{tuple} of C{tuple}s    
    
    @keyword Signal_ROI: This is the name of a file that contains a list of
                         pixel IDs that will be read from the data file and
                         stored as a signal C{SOM}
    @type Signal_ROI: C{string}
    
    @keyword dataset_type: The practical name of the dataset being processed.
                           The default value is I{data}.
    @type dataset_type: C{string}

    @keyword dst_type: The type of C{DST} to be created during file read-in.
                       The default value is I{application/x-NeXus}.
    @type dst_type: C{string}
    
    @keyword Verbose: This is a flag to turn on print statments. The default is
                      I{False}.
    @type Verbose: C{boolean}
    
    @keyword Timer: This is an SNS Timer object used for showing the
                    performance timing in the function.
    @type Timer: C{sns_timing.Timer}


    @return: Signal C{SOM.SOM} and monitor C{SOM.SOM}
    @rtype: C{tuple}
