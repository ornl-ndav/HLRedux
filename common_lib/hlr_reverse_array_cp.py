    This function reverses the y and var_y tuples of all the SOs in a SOM or
    an individual SO. This is assuming that there was a previous
    transformation on the x-axis of the SO or SOM.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    -> obj is the SOM or SO that needs to have its y and var_y tuples
       reversed

    Return:
    ------
    <- A SOM or SO containing the results of the reversal process

    Exceptions:
    ----------
    <- TypeError is raised if a tuple or list of tuples is presented to the
       function
